# Shill-Bidding-Detection

Dataset can be found on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset. In this project, we compare the algorithms used to do prediction about wheter a bid is or shill bidding. We use 3 types of alogirthm which are Decision Trees(Gain Ratio and Gini Index), Naive Bayes, ANN(1  hidden layer and 2 hidden layers) and SVM.
